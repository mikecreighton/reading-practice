# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

First, be sure to check out this repo's main `README.md` file to get up and running. The stuff below is just boilerplate Create React App language.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
