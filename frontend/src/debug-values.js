As the bus bounced along, she tried to eat her pasta lunch, but the noodles kept flying everywhere! Suddenly, the bus hit a bump, and her puzzle pieces scattered all over. The scientist scrambled to pick them up, accidentally grabbing a slice of pizza from a student's lunchbox instead of a puzzle piece. She stuck the pizza slice onto her puzzle, creating a very strange penguin with a cheesy beak. The bus driver saw this in the mirror and couldn't stop giggling. He missed the turn for the school and ended up at a park. All the kids cheered, thinking they were getting a surprise field trip, while the confused scientist stood there holding her pizza-penguin puzzle.`
